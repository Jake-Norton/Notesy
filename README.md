## Coding Day 1
First view created. I ended up changing out some of the colors I initially chose. All the file structures are there. Routes file is set up as well as the Auth and Header (partially) components. CSS for App, Auth and Header basically perfected. Registering and logging in should be functional but they haven't yet been tested. I attempted to work the responsive design for smaller screen adjustment, but the developer tool is making it look weird despite saying the dimensions are correct. Once I have more back-end coding done I'll try to figure it out and/or ask in the Q if this is actually normal.
